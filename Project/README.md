## SMART CROP MONITORING SYSTEM 

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy. It contributes to the gross domestic product. Agriculture meets the food requirements of the people and produces several raw materials for industries. But because of animal interference and fire in agricultural lands, there will be huge of crops. The crop will be totally getting destroyed. There will be a large amount of loss of farmers. To avoid these financial losses, it is very important to protect agricultural fields or farms from animals and fire. To overcome this problem, in our pro-posed work we shall design a system to prevent the entry of animals into the farm. Our main purpose of project is to develop intruder alert to the farm, to avoid losses due to animals and fire. These intruder alert protect the crop from damaging that indirectly increase yield of the crop. The develop system will not harmful and injurious to animal as well as human beings. Theme of project is to design a intelligent security system for farm protection by using Embedded system.
